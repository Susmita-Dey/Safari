##  🌟 Inspiration

Our biggest inspiration has been **Independence day** which is around the corner. India will celebrate its 75th Independence day. It is the day that reflects our pride and solidarity in India's diversity and its rich culture and heritage.

The _Safari game_ reflects our diverse culture and not only it is engaging and fun to play, but it also tests your knowledge about different states and Union territories of India. 
It's a complete package of fun, thrill, learning and testing your knowledge. 

## What it does 🔥

The Safari game is a board game that allows two players to compete against each other.
You can start right away [here](https://susmita-dey.github.io/Safari/)


#### Note: Set your resolution to full HD screen for the best experience 😇


### How to Play ✨

⚡The board game consists of **28 states and 8 Union Territories**.

⚡The player will throw dice(already on the screen) and will automatically be placed on the block according to the number on the dice.

⚡Upon reaching a block, the player would only be able to move ahead, if she answers all the questions about that State/Union Territory.

⚡But wait, Players can also come across the bonus or the trap block.

⚡The bonus block will allow you to move ahead of a certain block without popping up on the quiz.
The trap block does the opposite it will take you a few blocks black. Like the Snakes in the Snakes and Ladders.

⚡Remember snakes and ladder? Yeah, just add more fun to it. That means, **the Safari game intact the true essence of the classical Snakes and Ladders**.

## How we built it 🎁

We built our website using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Tailwind and the website has been hosted on Github pages.

## Challenges we ran into

❄️Building a fun project is entertaining but it also comes with a lot of challenges.

❄️Deciding the game plot that matches our theme of independence day and the idea of educating youth about our culture and heritage in a way that engages them, allows them to have fun and is not monotonous was quite challenging. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 😇

❄️We are proud of working as a team and building a project that lives up to our expectations.

❄️We are proud of building a board game that is more lively than any other board game which engages the players and allows them to expand their knowledge on the go.

❄️The game also has twists like a classic Snakes and Ladders, so Snakes and Ladders was never out of our theme.

❄️We learned a lot this weekend and through this Hackathon.

❄️We learned to work as a great team and the art of collaboration.

❄️We learned a lot about our country in the research process.

## What's next for Safari🚀

We plan on taking our project to new heights by making a Safari game app to make it more accessible.
